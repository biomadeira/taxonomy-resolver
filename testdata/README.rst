The ``taxdump.zip`` provided here is not a complete dump from NCBI Taxonomy FTP server.
It is a small hierarchy based on TaxID "40674" (for class 'Mammalia') used for testing the
functionality of Taxonomy Resolver.
The files ``names.dmp`` and ``nodes.dmp`` are provided for a quick look up, but these are the ones
included in the mock ``taxdump.zip``.
